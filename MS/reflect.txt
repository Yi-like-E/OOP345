In this workshop, I used most of the knowledge I learned in OOP345 this semester. For example, the container, the error handling, algorithms, lambda function, file streams, pointer, static variables, and rule of five. This project is not easy, especially the milestone3, the linemanger module, and the workstation module, it cost me a lot of time to figure out how does the linemanager constructor work and how to link each station.
In the beginning, I thought the constructor just read the words from the file and assign the value, as usual, however, this projectâ€™s design is different, it read the words then find the position of the same words in the container, then organize the words by its position/pointer.
In my opinion, it is a challenge for us to do. Design this project with the container is a more efficient way, I feel it is a little challenge, maybe I need more practice coding with the container, instead of using the array.
